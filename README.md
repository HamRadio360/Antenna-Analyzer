# K6BEZ Antenna Analyzer

The K6BEZ antenna analyzer will provide VSWR measurements for any antenna from 1 to 30 MHz.  Frequency and VSWR is shown on the built in LCD display.  Data can optionally be sent over the USB cable to a PC running a program that will plot the VSWR on a graphical window display.
The analyzer can be programmed to scan any sub band and has built in ranges for 160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, 10m.
